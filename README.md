## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

In this challenge, I was able to recall some good CSS styling practices, making the code less verbose by separating parts of the CSS to enhance readability. Additionally, I combined sections that shared common code in order to avoid unnecessary code duplication.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main class="container">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="Qr-code image" />
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <p>
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </div>
</main>
```

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```



### Continued development

I plan to keep challenging myself by not only continuing my studies but also putting all the acquired knowledge into practice, especially in more complex projects. I might even consider using a CSS superset along the way.
